## Models of Cybersecurity
The talented cybersecurity expert has knowledge about multiple facets of the problem space. They hold mental models of how things work together. The cybersecurity community is composed of experts in multiple disciplines and multiple specialized models.

It is inconceiveable that a single model can adequately cover the whole of cybersecurity. The Cyber Terrain Ontology brings together a collection of ontologies that describe in greater detail the bigger picture of cyber situational awareness. It is an ontology alignment project that resolves ambiguity that can exist between the separate ontologies being integrated together.
